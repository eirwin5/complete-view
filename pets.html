            Palmer, the 12-year-old black Yorkie Doodle, is a charming and
            endearing companion known for his sweet and gentle disposition.
            Despite his small stature, he leaves a big impression on everyone he
            meets. Palmer is a shy little guy, but his quiet demeanor only adds to
            his irresistible charm. He's not one to demand attention, but those
            who take the time to get to know him quickly fall in love with his
            loving nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Palmer's favorite pastime is lounging around, basking in the comfort
            of his cozy spot, often nestled in a sunbeam. He enjoys the simple
            pleasures in life, like curling up next to his loved ones and sharing
            his affection through gentle licks. His name, inspired by the
            legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, is a fitting tribute to his quiet
            grace and undeniable likability. In any social gathering or family
            gathering, Palmer steals the show, capturing the hearts of all who
            have the privilege of meeting him.

        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

          Luna is a German shepherd mix and a fireball of energy. Oftentimes,
          destroying anything in her path she will take and hide all your socks,
          shoes, and clothes for her to chew on. She loves playing catch at the
          park, it always gives her the zoomies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luna is a very jealous, loving, and protective dog. She really
          embraces her inner chihuahua and will bark at any stranger, car, or
          noise at night. She makes the perfect guard dog. But she is not at all
          aggressive. Luna is all bark no bite!

        <p>
          Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German
          shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially
          when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as
          he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he
          demands.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on
          and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also
          has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his
          father goes to bed.

        </div>
        <p>
          Mocha is a very energetic little dog. His favorite activities are
          tug-of-war with toys, playing fetch with his orange ball, and laying
          on his dad’s lap. He has so much energy that in the evenings he tends
          to ‘get the zoomies’ in which he sprints in circles around the house
          without any stimulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Mocha is done playing, he loves to lay down in an especially
          silly way. He lays on his belly with his rear paws pointed straight
          backwards as shown in the following photos. It’s his favorite way to
          recharge after a long day of play.

            width="400">
        </div>
        <p>
          Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go
          on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and
          belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys
          in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or
          cooling off in the garage.
        </p>
        <p>
          He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings
          the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards
          the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his
          tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as
          much as he likes to play.

        </div>
        <p>
          Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves
          her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She
          makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a
          loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it
          probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been
          empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic
          disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against
          keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they
          reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints
          and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is
          living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty
          while sacrificing the animals’ health.
