              endearing companion known for his sweet and gentle disposition.
              Despite his small stature, he leaves a big impression on everyone
              he meets. Palmer is a shy little guy, but his quiet demeanor only
              adds to his irresistible charm. He's not one to demand attention,
              but those who take the time to get to know him quickly fall in

          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.

          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling. Bacon
          Q. Dog, with his unique blend of sophistication and playful antics,
          has undoubtedly carved out a special place in the hearts of his
          family. His ability to find joy in the simplest of activities, whether
          it's lounging or orchestrating toy adventures, makes him a beloved and
          cherished member of the household, adding a touch of canine charm to
          each day.

          Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German
          shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially
          when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as
          he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he
          demands. Maui, the charismatic two-year-old mini-doodle, exudes a
          personality much larger than his petite stature. His self-perception
          as a German shepherd in a smaller package is reflected in his
          assertive nature, especially when it comes to expressing his desires,
          whether it be for food or attention. This confident and vocal demeanor
          makes Maui quite the character, as he skillfully communicates his
          needs, mastering the art of getting what he wants.

          During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on
          and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also
          has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his
          father goes to bed. When it comes to relaxation, Maui has a penchant
          for heights. Claiming the highest chair he can find, he perches
          himself there, creating a regal vantage point from which he can
          observe the world outside. Whether anticipating the arrival of guests
          or simply relishing the prospect of belly rubs, Maui's lounging time
          is an opportunity for him to indulge in the pleasures of a comfortable
          perch.

              Mocha is a very energetic little dog. His favorite activities are
              tug-of-war with toys, playing fetch with his orange ball, and
              laying on his dad’s lap. He has so much energy that in the
              evenings he tends to ‘get the zoomies’ in which he sprints in
              circles around the house without any stimulation. In addition to
              his playful antics, Mocha has a special bond with his dad, finding
              comfort in curling up on his lap. This connection underscores the
              affectionate and loyal nature that often characterizes canine
              companionship. Mocha's distinctive behaviors and lovable quirks
              contribute to the joy and warmth he brings to the household,
              making him a cherished member of the family.

              When Mocha is done playing, he loves to lay down in an especially
              silly way. He lays on his belly with his rear paws pointed
              straight backwards as shown in the following photos. It’s his
              favorite way to recharge after a long day of play. Mocha's vibrant
              personality and boundless energy make him a delightful companion.
              His enthusiasm for play is evident in his favorite activities,
              such as engaging in spirited games of tug-of-war with his
              cherished toys and gleefully fetching his bright orange ball.
              Mocha's playful spirit is not confined to specific playtimes; in
              the evenings, he unleashes the "zoomies," a burst of energy that
              manifests as joyful sprints in circular patterns around the house,
              showcasing his exuberance.

          Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go
          on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and
          belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys
          in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or
          cooling off in the garage.

        <p>
          He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings
          the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards
          the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his
          tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as
          much as he likes to play. One of Cooky's undeniable pleasures is
          indulging in tasty snacks and treats, though his discerning palate
          seems to favor these over his regular dog food. This little quirk adds
          a touch of charm to his culinary preferences. Cooky's love for play
          extends to his fondness for toys, which you can often find scattered
          across the living room as he engages in spirited games.

              Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She
              loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the
              ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by
              complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says
              could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the
              water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want
              to see the manager.”

              Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a
              genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly
              advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in
              constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage
              accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes
              painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s
              cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the
              animals’ health.
