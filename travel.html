          Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore,
          is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan’s beautiful
          Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly
          100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured
          Rocks! (source: https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)

          No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured
          Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required).
          Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is
          from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the
          Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view
          the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state
          regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings
          otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing,
          skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check
          road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the
          winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail! (source:
