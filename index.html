                Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National
                Lakeshore, is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in
                Michigan’s beautiful Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10
                inland lakes, and nearly 100 miles of trails, everyone can find
                something to enjoy at Pictured Rocks!
                <br />
                No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured
                Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit
                required). Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see
                the cliffs is from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall:
                Autumn colors in the Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking,
                drive the park roads to view the changing leaves! Hunting and
                fishing opportunities (state regulations apply) abound during
                fall! Winter: Cold weather brings otherworldly frozen
                waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing, skiing, and ice
                fishing are other popular winter activities. Check road closures
                and conditions before heading into the park in the winter.
                Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail!

                Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It
                covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to
                see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone
                contains about half the world's active geysers.
                <br />
                These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions
                among the tourists. Every year visitors injure themselves or the
                wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples

                Sequoia National Park is a large forest located in the Sierra
                Nevada mountain range in California. It is famous for its
                gigantic sequoia and redwood trees, as well as its underground
                Crystal Cave. The park is a well-known attraction to many
                tourists, receiving more than a million visitors annually. In
                addition to its collection of giant trees, Sequoia National Park
                is also home to thousands of prevalent flora and fauna.
                <br />
                Perhaps the most famous feature of Sequoia National Park is the
                General Sherman tree – the largest tree in the world. Measuring
                in at 275 feet tall, the tree towers over the surrounding
                landscape and the people who come to view it. As of today, the
                General Sherman tree is estimated to be around 2200 years old.

                Beyond its natural splendor, Acadia National Park is home to an
                array of wildlife, from peregrine falcons soaring above the
                cliffs to elusive white-tailed deer roaming the forests.
                Visitors can also explore the historic Jordan Pond House, a
                charming tea house overlooking Jordan Pond, where they can
                indulge in the park's famous popovers while surrounded by the
                serenity of nature. Whether scaling the heights of Cadillac
                Mountain or enjoying a leisurely day by the sea, Acadia National
                Park captivates all who venture into its embrace, offering an
                enriching experience that combines the tranquility of nature
                with a deep sense of historical and ecological significance.
                <br />
                Acadia National Park, nestled along the rugged coastline of
                Maine, stands as a testament to the stunning beauty of the
                northeastern United States. Established in 1916, Acadia is
                celebrated as the first national park east of the Mississippi
                River. The park covers over 49,000 acres, encompassing a diverse
                landscape that includes granite peaks, lush forests, pristine
                lakes, and the iconic rocky shores of Mount Desert Island.
                Acadia's crown jewel is Cadillac Mountain, the tallest peak on
                the U.S. Atlantic coast, offering visitors a breathtaking
                panoramic view of the sunrise that is among the first to touch
                the continental United States. The park's unique blend of
                mountainous terrain and coastal scenery provides an
                extraordinary setting for a variety of outdoor activities, from
                hiking and biking on an extensive network of trails to exploring
                the tranquil carriage roads designed by John D. Rockefeller Jr.
