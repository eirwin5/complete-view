              Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore,
              is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan’s beautiful
              Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly
              100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured
              Rocks!

            No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured
            Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required).
            Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is
            from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the
            Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view
            the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state
            regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings
            otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing,
            skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check
            road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the
            winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail!

              Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers
              over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife
              and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half
              the world's active geysers.

            These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among

              Sequoia National Park is a large forest located in the Sierra Nevada
              mountain range in California. It is famous for its gigantic sequoia
              and redwood trees, as well as its underground Crystal Cave. The park
              is a well-known attraction to many tourists, receiving more than a
              million visitors annually. In addition to its collection of giant
              trees, Sequoia National Park is also home to thousands of prevalent
              flora and fauna.

            Perhaps the most famous feature of Sequoia National Park is the
            General Sherman tree – the largest tree in the world. Measuring in at
            275 feet tall, the tree towers over the surrounding landscape and the
            people who come to view it. As of today, the General Sherman tree is
            estimated to be around 2200 years old.
